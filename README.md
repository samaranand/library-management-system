# library-management-system

my first project in C. this was my college project in 2nd sem !!

this is the my first project in C and at that time i was using windows 10 and was newbie in C so may be.. it may run in another OS or not.
This project is based on Library management and how the books will be kept and students DB as well.

basically i m putting it here so that community can get idea for their first C project.

later on.. i will add few screenshots of running application. thank you (:
